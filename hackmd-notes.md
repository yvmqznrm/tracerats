<summary markdown="span">Storm</summary>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/QFhrKga.jpg"
class="PFP" />

Age:
- 23

Hacking motivations:
- national security threat in past, against "Sicherheitstheater"

What drives him in general?
- Storm has an idea for doing something to rectify an injustice which he's very emotionally invested in, and after spending a decent amount of time planning this idea, he is beginning to play the long game and becomes extremely emotionally invested in the success of his plan, to the point where it becomes his perceived predominant purpose in  life. Feeling that he is responsible for the safety and well being of the other group members, Storm holds this also as an important purpose for him, which pushes him into taking on a leadership role.

Strengths:
- logical thinking + (mostly) rational behaviour
- curiosity + technical creativity
- passionate/driven
- unafraid

Flaws:
- violent outbursts sometimes, disapproving of things if they aren't being done his way (except for with mayhem, he's seen her smarts and trusts her), trust issues
- perfectionism
- sometimes unpredictable
- ego
(altered version for when younger: reckless, lack of awareness of limitations)

Job:
- works on satellites (gives him access to broadcasting infrastructure) or at a Certificate Authority (being able to make certificates would also be helpful) (either way he's playing the long game)
    

OTHER NOTES:
- storm founded the group with mayhem and is the driving force behind it

Flaws:
- does not think far enough / irresponsible (her and storm complement each other very well in the sense that he's very rational and grounds her sometimes and he's kinda too unable to have fun due to it and she keeps him going and her positive vibes and energy leaks onto him)

___

# What is each character's biggest weakness?

### Storm
his temper, how deeply he cares for mayhem, the deeper he's into a plan the less flexible he becomes
<br>

### Mayhem
impulsivity
<br>

### Soph
her addictive personality, her love for ashley
<br>

### Ashley
overly compassionate + easily gets worried, especially about soph
<br>

### Michael
low self esteem, weak will to live
<br>

### Dev
his inability to open up
<br>

### Nova
undisciplined, can't keep schedules and sometimes inattentive + lack of life experience
<br>

### Ada
doesn't form deep emotional connections (-> loneliness?)
prejudiced (as in doesn't understand and judges other moral systems)
<br>


### Player
distractability
intense emotions

___

# What is the biggest secret each character holds?

### Storm
The hack on the police station (with Josh and Noah) when he was 15 which resulted in Josh's suicide.
<br>

### Mayhem
Possibly that she's not always as happy and bubbly as she seems, since she rarely lets it show when she's not doing too well.
<br>

### Soph
Her problems with substance addiction in the past. At first, she doesn't want to tell anyone form the group in case she is negatively judged. However, even after she has started feeling very comfortable and has the feeling of being in the family, she still doesn't mention it because she's worried that Storm would see it as a breach of trust because he wasn't told earlier, and also that she might receive negative judgement from him.
<br>

### Ashley
Sometimes looking after Soph becomes a bit too much and she wishes that she didn't have to.
<br>

### Michael
His troubles with mental health, and how he met Storm (he was about to jump off a bridge and Storm stopped him).
<br>

### Dev
Dev is not one to share details about his inner world at all.
<br>

### Nova
Past victimization, sexual in nature (SA or rape) > homeless b4 squat: groomed by adult + drugs bc of him
<br>

### Ada
fabricating evidence to get someone who she knew was indeed guilty behind bars, because they were going to go free due to lack of evidence
daughter
<br>

___

# What is each character's relationship with their parents?


### Storm
Barely ever sees or speaks to them (only when necessary) because they were very emotionally and physically abusive towards him when he was younger.
<br>

### Mayhem
Mayhem's mother has a very hedonistic view on life, and never had much focus or drive to work towards anything meaningful, instead opting for momentary happiness. In contrast, Mayhem is driven not only by the pursuit of pleasure, but also by her desire to affect positive change in the world, and her close friendship with Storm keeps her focused. Mayhem's father is a workaholic airline pilot who isn't with his family much, and so Mayhem is kind of distant from him.
<br>

### Soph
Soph cannot imagine anything worse than ending up like her mother, who neglected her during her childhood due to severe genetic depression, and so avoids her as much as possible. In order to avoid this, in the past she sent so far as to turn to self-medicating with stimulants. Now, she just avoids all contact with her mother. Soph's father left the family due to her mother's inability to function.
<br>

### Ashley
Ashley's parents are sweet, and are very supportive of her in many different ways (e.g. her being trans, her jobs, her relationship). The fact that they are supportive of her relationship with Soph gives comfort not only to Ashley but also to Soph.
<br>

### Michael
Michael's parents always had very high expectations of him, which were unrealistic for him to live up to. Instead of acknowledging his efforts and achievements and encouraging him to continue, they chose to criticise and belittle him, which left him with a very low self-esteem. Thus, Michael had to find a chosen family who actually appreciated him, and to this day he avoids contact with his biological family. 
<br>

### Dev
Whilst fighting against nazis as a partisan in France, his father was in desperate need of a place to hide, and a friend of his contacted Dev's mother, who allowed him to hide in her home. When it became apparent that his mother was pregnant, his parents moved to Guadeloupue for the safety of their child, where Dev was born. They find that life moves too slowly for them there, and so they move to London after the war.
In the '80s, Dev and his friend were hanging out, when a group of four extreme right wing 20-something year old rich-kids perceived his friend to be effeminate. Assuming they were a gay couple, they verbally attack them, and when Dev didn't take any shit, telling them to "fuck off", they became physically aggressive. Dev defended himself effectively, but unfortunately, when four rich kids with good lawyers and the only injuries come up against two guys with public defenders, who's the jury going to lean towards? Dev's mother was outraged that he has been unjustly imprisoned, while his father was more resigned to the inevitability of unfairness.
In prison, Dev came across a computer hacker who told him stories about what he had done and what was possible in terms of computer hacking. This really interested Dev, who went on to extensively familiarise himself with computers. Through the years, Dev followed along with the developments in the computer and hacking world, thereby acquiring a good understanding starting from the very fundamentals. He branched out to electronics, and began creating useful contraptions (e.g. short range emergency radio location system (for mountain/avalanche), or ambient intensity activated head torch).
Dev's mum died in the '00s, with his dad wasting away his last few years grieving her loss. Not wanting himself to waste part of the rest of his life like this, Dev made it his mission to have fun experiencing the world and going on adventures.
<br>

### Nova
estranged
Nova came out to parents as teen, got kicked out, lived w mayhem for a while, then Mayhems parents disn't want them around anymore
They borrow some money from mayhem and go to live in a squat in London
<br>

### Ada

<br>

### Player
Parents not in the picture

___

# Which characters have a criminal history?

### Storm
Backstory with Josh and Noah

### Soph
Soph was addicted to a stimulant drug, which she started taking as a teenager to self-medicate to avoid ending up unable to function as a result of her genetic depression (like her mother).

When she was twenty, her long-time dealer got busted, and so she was desperately looking for another good supply before her stock ran out, whilst being extremely paranoid that she was being investigated by the police from the texts that would have been found on the dealer's phone.

She ends up running out of her drug, and as withdrawal symptoms begin to set in, she obtains some more from another supplier who seems the least untrustworthy. The product which she is sold is laced with another narcotic, and when she takes it, she ends up almost dying, being saved by antidote.

Once her condition had somewhat improved, she had a very heated argument with her girlfriend, Ashley, who had been trying to get her to stop taking the stimulant for some time. At this point, Soph realised the severity of her situation and though she was still worried about ending up like her mother, she saw that there was no other way to continue.

### Dev
See last question (r.e. relationship with parents). 

### Nova
Petty crimes when they were homeless

<br>

### Soph

<br>

### Ashley
Spends quality time with people (especially Soph), despite having a packed schedule most of the time
<br>

### Michael
Encourages and compliments people + is an active listener

Depending on the situation: makes comic style drawings (see below), or goes out to do stuff with friends.
<br>

### Soph
Buries herself in learning extensively about whatever may peak her interest at the time.
<br>

### Ashley
Making and playing music
<br>

### Michael
Stress eating while going on a video game spree. Although, on a good day, he will focus his mind on his networking activities.
<br>

### Dev
Usually, Dev's stress levels remain fairly low, because he tends to remove himself from stressful situations. When he does get stressed about something, the stress therefore tends to be more severe, and so he will spend 1 or 2 nights away from his day-to-day things, by going camping in the countryside, or other adventurous activities.
<br>

### Nova
switch between fighting sports (beat the shit out of a boxing bag) and sitting back and philosophically thinking about struggles to find solutions
<br>

### Ada
burying self in work, rock bottom -> alcohol
<br>

### Player
They find it hard to cope and suffer fro panic attacks, however, we can show the others helping them out and maybe bring attention to a few methods that could help people irl

___

# Does each character see themself as a hero or a anti-hero?

### Storm
- Doesn't put himself into a category, he is doing what he feels he has to do about things that he sees as major issues to society. (Think Edward Snowden)
- From an external perspective: Anti-hero
<br>

### Mayhem
- Categorises herself as a regular hero, but not in the glamorous "over the top" sense. She is down to earth, and also recognises that she has some flaws.
- From an external perspective: It fits
<br>

### Soph
- Doesn't feel able to categorise herself, because she sees the world as too gray to be able to tell what side she's actually on. She would like to think that her moral compass is pointing generally in the generally good direction.
- From an external perspective: A bit of an anti-hero
<br>

### Michael
- Michael's motives for joining the group have more to do with friendship/companionship than the group's objective, and so he doesn't see what he's doing in that regard to be heroic. However, over time, the motivations that the other group members have for working towards the objective begin to rub off on him.
- From an external perspective: Neither, he's kind of a helpful NPC
<br>

### Dev
- Dev knows he's doing good, and would reluctantly categorise himself as a regular hero, recognising that he is flawed (e.g. insincerity, unreliability).
- From an external perspective: Also regular hero (with flaws)
<br>

### Nova
- doesn't believe in universally good or bad
<br>

### Ada
- sees herself as someone who "does the right thing" and "keeps everything in order"
<br>

# Is each character more of a leader or a follower?


### Storm
leader (not by choice though)
<br>

### Mayhem
leader
<br>

### Soph
mostly leader, but smart enough to follow when she doesn't know what she's doing or the other person knows better (interestingly she's more introverted, but has no problem standing up for things she believes are right/better)
<br>

### Ashley
despite being outgoing, she's more of a follower. She compromises a lot and struggles to choose any hills to die on
<br>

### Michael
follower to a fault (it's one of his flaws)
<br>

### Dev
he kinda cba to lead most of the time, but isn't a follower either, only leads if it's important enough to him, otherwise if he doesn't lead and the situation is not going according to his intentions for it he just fucks off
<br>

### Nova
flexible
<br>

### Ada
leader to group, follower to law

# How are each of the characters with kids?

### Storm
probably lowkey pissed off until they go to far and he starts shouting (HE'S THE ONE WHO SHOULD NEVER BE LEFT WITH KIDS)
<br>

### Mayhem

<br>

### Soph
probably would just make them watch tv and do her stuff in the next room
<br>

### Ashley
would probably be fine but not necessarily keen on it
<br>

### Michael
to him it would be like there's just little aliens walking around in his place (he doesn't understand children)
<br>

### Dev
the kids would probably have a great time but he'd be irresponsible and do crazy adventure stuff with them that their parents wouldn't approve of because of safety concerns lol
<br>

### Nova
fairly neutral, but might try to explain nihilism to them...
<br>

### Ada
pretty good w kids (has daughter)

<br>

___

# What is each character's purpose in their own universe? Are they a ruler or an important figure? Are they on a mission to save the world?

### Storm
- Storm has an idea for doing something to solve a problem which he cares deeply about, and after spending a decent amount of time planning this idea, he is beginning to play the long game and becomes extremely emotionally invested in the success of his plan, to the point where it becomes his perceived predominant purpose in  life. Feeling that he is responsible for the safety and wellbeing of the other group members, Storm holds this also as an important purpose for him, which pushes him into taking on a leadership role.

### Mayhem
- Curious AF, so learns about all sorts of things and picks up useful skills
- Has personally experienced racial injustice, so she is very driven to utilise her skills to rectify injustices in general.

### Soph
- Intense need to keep learning
- Applying the things she has learned to help improve the world.

### Ashley

<br>

### Soph
addictive personality (substances in the past, now redirected to hunger for knowledge, she needs to always be learning, this could make her burnt out)
<br>

<br>

### Michael
shit mental health that keeps him back, is kind of a follower (goes along with what others say)
<br>

### Up to Josh’s death and aftermath

Storm+Josh+Noah DOSkids

Personality:
XXX
Interests:
XXX
Familial situation:
Storm’s parents are very unpleasant people in general, and have distanced themselves from the rest of the family since Storm was very young. They start being progressively more emotionally and physically abusive towards Storm starting with XXX when he’s around XXX and worsening to the point of XXX by the time he’s finishing year 8 at age 13. Thus, storm has from them zero emotional or financial support to pursue the things he loves to do/is good at, rather he is put down and mocked by them on top of being beaten. He must therefore be resourceful and get things done on his own and in spite of his parents. He has lived in the same terraced house in the (XXX) part/region of the city since he was very young.
Friends and Stories/Timeline:
Meeting Josh and getting started with computers:
Storm first starts getting to know Josh in year 3 (aged 7-8) when Josh joined the school (both are around the same age). They are both in the same class (at that age your class is usually the same for all subjects), and end up sitting next to each other in the ICT class. At that age, ICT involves familiarising the pupils with the basics of how to use computers, what they can be used for, and introducing them to some basic software tools. Though Josh seems kind of nervous and doesn’t talk much, both of them are ‘curious little shits’ and quickly start experimenting with the software together far beyond the basics that the teacher teaches them, with the interest and curiosity enabling Josh to feel more comfortable around Storm than he usually feels around other people. This continues both during class and in break/lunch times, when the computer room is available for use. Having familiarised themselves with all the available pre-built software over a few months, they start getting into programming, starting with the recently released Scratch (scratch.mit.edu) which they use to make some super simple little scripts and games, familiarising themselves with the very fundamental concepts of programming and allowing them to express their creativity. Then they move on to some lower-level languages, starting with some super simple web design (HTML, CSS & JS), and begin expanding from there through all the big players, (Java, PHP, C++, the emerging Python, etc.).
Meeting Noah and starting to hang out:
It’s around this time, when Storm is 10 years old, that Josh introduces Storm to one of his old friends from when he was really young called Noah who he previously didn’t spend a lot of time with, but he recently found out that Noah was also really into computers. Noah is a year older than the other two. The three start to meet up more and more regularly at Josh’s house, because he lives in between the houses of the other two, and develop their understanding and skills in the field of programming together, as well as having fun doing other things and becoming good friends.
Storm funding his interests:
At school, first finds ways to allow people to play games, then finds some simple cheats to sell to people.
Due to the character of his parents (see ‘Familial situation’ above), Storm receives no financial support from them with regards to things that he is interested in and learning about. Up until now, he has been using the school’s computers on almost a daily basis, and has had to borrow equipment from Josh and Noah when meeting up with them at Josh’s house. This means that he can only do what he loves during specific times, and also not when he is at home, when it would also be a welcome distraction from his highly detrimental home situation.

Luckily, Noah has taught him the basics needed to pick the different types of locks on the various public telephone types across the city. For the purposes of not being caught, Storm makes an efficient route to travel to all the public telephones which are within boxes in the area daily, and makes a note as to how much money each one typically fills with just before being emptied. After taking the average of multiple fillings, he is able to repeat this route at regular intervals and remove a specific amount of coins from each phone regardless of how full it is at the time which amounts to about 2% of the expected amount of money in the box when it is emptied. Thus, the phone companies will not notice a statistically significant reduction in the amount of money in the boxes for at least the first few months (although they could still notice a slight discrepancy between expected income based on call time and actual income, at this point I’m just being pedantic, sorry :-) ). After a few months, Storm has enough money to buy a decent laptop [Let’s add a specific one].
Developing interests:
Storm, Noah, and Josh continue to meet up and and start delving into [Insert things which are on the learning-path to having the skills required to do the things in the future of the plot, consult hive people who know this stuff]
Josh’s Severe Panic Attack (Josh’s age = 12):
One day, the three friends are excited about visiting a large tech shop that they’ve heard about that’s not too far away [Add further description?]. They walk in and it’s bustling with lots of people talking excitedly. Josh begins to feel kind of strange and over the next couple of minutes fully develops the symptoms associated with a severe panic attack. Some people from the shop help Storm and Noah to try and reassure him and after a while Josh’s symptoms begin to lessen. One of the people asks him if this has happened before, and Josh responds that he thinks so, but the feelings were a lot less intense. This person asks for Josh’s parents’ number and tells them about what happened and that they think that Josh may benefit from seeing a mental health professional. Over the next few months (having experienced more panic attacks of varying severity), Josh is diagnosed with severe generalised anxiety disorder, and undergoes therapy for around [time] before his condition is seen to have improved by enough for him to stop therapy, with the frequency and intensity of his panic attacks having been reduced.
Staying with Josh for two months:
Towards the very end of year 8 (2012, Storm’s age = 13), the level of physical and psychological abuse that Storm is experiencing from his parents, as well as the fact that it has been going on for a long time drives him to ask if he can stay with Josh for a while. Thankfully, Josh’s parents are ok with this (Storm’s parents don’t give a shit anyway), and Storm begins to feel a lot better, for him the difference in home environment is unimaginably large, and while he is not necessarily ‘loved’, the fact that he is not demeaned and physically abused has a significant improvement on his feeling of life. During this time, the three friends meet up as usual at Josh’s place.
Returning to his parents’ house (early August):
After around two months of Storm staying at Josh’s house, Josh’s parents start feeling uncomfortable that he has lived there for so long, and send him back home. [BTW, I presume Josh’s parents don’t know about the abuse, right?] Storm is devastated at having to return to the abuse that he had had a taste of freedom from for two months. He doesn’t meet up with Josh or Noah for three weeks.
Mayhem:
Around a week after he has to return to his parents’ house, Mayhem and her mother move in next to Storm. See [Groups of characters who are considered ‘major’ in the present] > [Storm and Mayhem]
Meeting up with Josh and Noah again:
About three weeks after having to go back to live in his parents’ house, Storm resumes hanging out with Josh and Noah, but now they hang out at Noah’s place because there’s a bit of a weird feeling with Josh’s parents, and though it’s further for Storm to travel to, Noah’s parents both work during the afternoon and evening, so a lot of the time they have the place to themselves after school. Storm mentions that he has a new neighbour that he’s spent the last couple of weeks talking to and sees that she has grown an interest in computers too as a result of some things he’s shown her, but the group decides that it’s best not to tell Mayhem about them because some of the things they get up to might not necessarily be appropriate for an 11 year old and Josh doesn’t generally do great with meeting new people.
Getting into hacking:
By now, the trio has started becoming more interested in utilising their intellect as well as the collective skills that they have developed over the years for the purposes of finding ways to do things to things in ways that were non intended by the designers of those things (a.k.a. hacking). They find this concept really fun, and [add things that they learn and try out and how they find stuff out online and on their own including video game hacked client making].
[A less significant real life hack that they carried out, library or smth]:
[idk, we could come up with a general thing and ask around on the hive or research online for details. Something easy that’s helped by old software/security practices, because they’re 15-16 after all, although I know it’s possible to go bigger like Aaron Swartz but it leaves more room for their skills to develop further in the future, because there’s quite a few years until the present day]

### The incident with the police
Noah is 16, and Storm and Josh are 15. Having successfully [reference above], the ambitious teens decide that it’s time to go bigger. They think the network of the local police [thinking about changing this because in the uk this would be pretty secure] is probably on outdated tech running outdated software with outdated security too, and decide to investigate.

They found out/realised that [insert hacking details]. Now having access to the networked printers, [maybe some desktops too and can put stuff on screens? Maybe not, don’t want them to seem too good yet to leave more room to grow. Depends on how secure the stuff is, again, ask on hive etc.] being teenagers they begin to print as many pages as possible with “You’ve been hacked by [group name], have fun ;-)” on them. Unfortunately, Noah had made the mistake in the past of referencing the group’s name on his Facebook account somewhere. Furthermore, he posted a photo of himself together with the other two on the night of the hack, and so two days later all three of them had their homes raided by police, had their computers seized, and were arrested.

Storm gives the police the password for his laptop (which had an encrypted HDD) to avoid being convicted under Section 53 of RIPA 2000, which is the laptop that the attack was carried out from. Unfortunately, Storm has failed to remove from the laptop information which implicates the trio, and so they are charged under Section 1 of the Computer Misuse Act 1990. The maximum penalty for this is 2 years imprisonment and/or a fine, so they would likely get at most a few months.

For two more days they remain in custody at the police station, during which time they are interrogated rather harshly by officers who haven’t had training in dealing with children and especially those with severe anxiety. These officers consider the actions of the trio to be a national security risk because it was a police station that was targeted. This contributes to the harsh treatment . They are to be transferred to a young offenders prison the following day to await judgement or bail. Early the following morning, Storm and Noah hear a commotion. Josh has been found deceased in his cell, having suffocated himself using his trousers.

Due to sheer incompetence in evidence handling by the local police service, they failed to make copies of the evidence incriminating the trio for the hack which was on Storm’s laptop. Storm, thinking it was cool more than for any actual security benefit, had set up a dead-man-switch in the firmware of his laptop, requiring that a code be entered within 72 hours of it having previously been entered, else the HDD is repeatedly overwritten with random bits. Spending only one night in the young offender’s prison before it is realised that the evidence incriminating them no longer exists, Storm and Noah are released because they never confessed during the interrogations.

### After Joshs death
Storm feels absolutely terrible that his actions have at least partially resulted in Josh committing suicide, and blames himself for Josh’s death. He begins distancing himself from all the people he knows, and notably completely stops teaching and helping Mayhem with regards to computers and hacking, for fear of causing harm to somebody her or anybody else who gets involved with him, especially in the field of computers. He himself doesn’t touch a computer for an entire fortnight, before no longer being able to resist the pull.

Spending a lot of time on his own, Storm begins to think deeply about his life, resulting in a personality change from more chaotic and turbulent to very logical, although at times of extreme emotional load, he returns temporarily to his chaotic/turbulent state.

    General notes:
After Josh dies, Storm is kind of a logical anchor for Mayhem, while for him she is a source of enthusiasm [Not sure if I got this right/needs more detail]. This is just a temporary note to incorporate into the stories below. Maybe there’ll be a subsection for this kind of info, or it will just be inserted in the right spot in the timeline, or not at all.
First meeting:
After Mayhem moves in next to Storm, she sees him taking out the rubbish from her window, and later on that day she goes and knocks on his door, hoping to make friends with someone in her new home area. Storm’s father answers the door, and Mayhem asks him about their son, but he is curt and very dismissive, so Mayhem leaves. Storm heard this interaction from his room, and having just returned to so later on he goes and knocks on Mayhem’s door. He apologises for his parents, and Mayhem invites him in for a bit, although she and her mother are still busy unpacking from the move. They have a nice chat, and agree to meet up again.
First couple of weeks:
Meeting up with Mayhem a couple more times, he shows her some of the stuff he is able to do with his computer, like [insert 2012 cool kid programming/other stuff] . Mayhem is intrigued and wants to learn more, quickly becoming interested in the multitudes of possibilities that computers can open up, and especially the idea of being able to more directly control them when interacting with them at a lower level than the software used by 99% of the population allows you to. Storm starts off by introducing her to [insert multiple]. By the end of the first couple of weeks that they spend together, Mayhem has started to learn and investigate things more independently, and has [insert mini-project]. They also decide on the pseudonym “Mayhem” for her, because [insert reason].
School:
Mayhem and Storm don’t go to the same school: while Storm goes to the closest school, which is co-educational, Mayhem’s mum sends her to an all-girls school.
More stuff, introducing hacking as Storm kinda gets into it with his other friends too:
More stuff
Aftermath of Josh’s death:
Mayhem sees Storm returning home with his parents after he is released from prison. She hasn’t seen him in a few days, which is not abnormal, but he is rarely seen with his parents. Mayhem doesn’t think much of it, but over the next few days she notices that he seems to be avoiding her, is far less lively than usual and carries a sullen demeanour. He doesn’t really want to talk, especially about hacking. Mayhem is concerned, and asks Storm about what is going on, but he won’t tell her anything. This goes on for [time, a couple of months?].

During this time, Mayhem continues to further her development in the general area of computers and computer hacking, and eventually, seeing that Mayhem will not stop anytime soon and is as captivated by the field as he is, Storm decides to start helping and collaborating with her again, bringing her almost up to his level in terms of skills and understanding by [date].

<summary markdown="span" style="font-size:1.5em; font-weight:bold">Mayhem</summary>
    

Given name: Malika
DoB: Feb 2001
Relative height: short

Before moving in 2012:
Familial situation:
Mayhem’s father (add name?) is an enjoyment seeking workaholic who spends a lot of time away from home because he’s an airline pilot, and thus barely interacts with the rest of the family. Mayhem’s mother (add name?) has a very hedonistic view of life, living in the moment and not planning ahead, and mayhem loves her, but knows that she has her 'head in the clouds'. Mayhem has a sister, Zoriah, who is 13 years older than her, and thus does not really spend a lot of time with her or open up to her about anything. The family doesn’t have a lot of money. They live in a semi-detached house on the outskirts of town.




Friends:
Jamie:
A few months older than Mayhem, Short | Friendly, Helpful, Adrenaline Junkie | Judo | Stable/Average family.
Jamie enjoys messing around/playing/being mischievous.
    Zoe: 
Less than a month age difference from Mayhem, Average height | Happy with little, Positive | Likes playing pretend | Unstable & poor family.
Zoe is more reasonable/logical, understands that actions have (sometimes multiple) consequences, and thinks things through before doing them. She’s up for being mischievous if she knows that she will not get caught, and tries to prevent her friends from getting themselves into trouble.
    Olivia (Liv):
A few months younger than Mayhem, Tiny | Introverted/Easily nervous, Gets attached quickly | fucking loves planes and wants to be a pilot because she wants to see the clouds from above | Her parents criticise her a lot/are perfectionists who want even their kid to be perfect.
Liv is from the year below the other three, who have taken her in since she doesn’t get along well with the people in her year. She needs strong encouragement/to be dragged along in order to do fun stuff that she likes (she doesn’t take initiative on her own ideas, and needs others to confirm that her ideas are good and then drag her along in order for her ideas to be carried out).
    Jayden:
(somewhat more distant) friend, a little mischievous too
    Charlotte:
also somewhat more distant friend, the joking "sarcastic friend" (turns out to be nonbinary later, changes name to Charlie, band member in ashley’s band)
jamie - bicurious
zoe - lesbian
liv - ace
jayden - token straight person
Stories:
Attempting to run away from kindergarten:
One day Mayhem and Jamie decide to run away from kindergarten and go to walk around and have some fun, but just after they stealthily hop over the fence, a teacher coming back from the shops on a free period or on a smoking break or something spots them on the pavement high-fiving in celebration, and so their ‘little excursion’ abruptly comes to an unexpected and premature end.
Planning to break into the school computer room to play video games:
When they’re in year 5 (aged 9-10) Mayhem and Jamie consider leaving a window unlatched in the school’s computer room, so as to enable them to sneak in after school and play computer games. They let Zoe in on their plan, and she advises them very strongly against carrying it out, having conducted a risk-benefit analysis. They decide to follow Zoe’s advice.

### Moves to town
move away from dad and towards countryside (lived in small shitty town - bigger than other town but not too big - with no pretty views or anything) - mom hedonistic af etc bla bla
Location:
(Medium sized town, but with no pretty countryside around)
During the summer holidays between primary and secondary school (2012, between years 6&7, Mayhem’s age = 11), Mayhem's mum decides to move to a small town in the countryside. As a result, towards the end of the holidays (mid August), Mayhem and her family move house.

    ## Soph

Soph, dad left baby cause couldn't take it w/ mum's depressions, she struggled to take care of her mum, started going out more and met the people who got her into drugs, at some point she went to a Yungblud concert where she met ashley


---

Soph lived in Brixton with her mentally ill mum as a kid. Her mum had severe genetic depression, resulting in her neglecting Soph and herself. Soph's dad left the family due to his partner's inability to function.

From a young age, Soph cared for herself and her mother, however when she was around 12, she started to get sick of the responsibility, because it was really taxing and draining. She starts to care for her mother less and argue with her more, and spends more time away from home, leaving whenever she is sick of being there.

Soph started hanging out with some people that she met while walking around outside. One day, she asked if she could have a puff of someone's joint, and from then on met up with them on most evenings. They began to show less restraint in taking other drugs in her presence, and soon she was being offered [insert drug names].

Reminder: love languages (helpful to know, doesn't have to be the same, compromise is ok)

Soph
Solves people’s problems and helps them out with things + spends time with people (not necessarily doing much, just being in their presence)

Ashley
Spends quality time with people (especially Soph), despite having a packed schedule most of the time



Ashley finds cat in serious danger, needs to call for help (e.g. from fire brigade or a vet), doesn't have phone available, runs into the petrol station nearby to ask someone to call for help. She frantically asks for help out loud for the people in the shop to hear, and Soph immediately helps.

search for cats owners - at some point more realize that they're not gonna find them - ash: "well I guess it's our cat now" soph:"our cat?" - soph greater awareness of relationship forming

soph seems to have shit together - ashley more dreamy and messy "why can't I be like that", sees Soph as a perfect person

soph: ashley is so kind (also perfect person thing) and I don't need to tell her about the substance add - "I don't need to bother her" type thing.

Injoke: cat higher conscience manipulated fate to get them together
Looks all perfect, they've just moved in together, Ashley starts to see signs of aderall adiction, talks to Soph, Soph is in denial that it's a problem, says No I don't this isn't a problem, encourages her to seek help.

Relationship becomes rocky, it's all a bit much and Ashley stays on couch of former flatshare (former roomates take her in for now), uncertainty as to whether they'll stay together, they become less close and there is tension, they think they may be close to breaking up. Some tension caused by Soph feeling that Ashley is trying to take the drugs away from her and that she doesn't have a problem. 

Soph, unrelated to Ashley, has lightbulb moment of "oh, I do need help", she decides to get help, goes through rehab, ashley sticks with her through this.

Makes amends, Soph like I'm sorry, even if you hadn't been right, I shouldn't have reacted that way at all because you were concerned for me, and obv you *were* right.

Relationship gets seemingly much better, everything is going really nicely, smooth sailing period "we fixed it, everything's great, problem over" phase, mostly from Soph. However root problem is not fixed.

Soph relapses bc her job starts requiring absolutely ridiculous ammounts of work from her (fuck capitalism) and that together with the addiction leads to her taking Adderal again.

She thinks relationship over, thinking about last time it happened, she's gonna be mad at me, she should be mad at me, what if she leaves me, she's going to leave me etc. (doomspiraling)
Ashley comes home and Soph lashes out and picks a fight over nothing (to prove herself right kinda), she feels like it's all gonna end so she wants to force it to, tries to pick a fight to drive her away.

Ashley: *sees that this is completely out of character and says so* What's going on? this is not like you at all! Soph confesses. and "But you're just going to leave me anyway, I've fucked up too bad" Ashley: stop trying to push me away because you think I'd leave anyway. I know that addiction is a life long illness and that it will always be a thing. I also know that I'll always be here with you through that and that I'm not going away. That being said, don't get salty at me again, Soph is like, yeah, I understrand, I'm not going to do that again. (ashley auto immune disorder - helps her relate to soph)

Having now openly communicated about everything, the two navigate their relationship with more confidence and trust. They have a healthy smooth sailing time that is actually based on a learning to work together to deal with stuff, and not on accidenting their way into just not hitting conflict. 

From there on they work out systems for dealing with tempting situations, like a relapse prevention plan*. They also both don't drink (cause that could make soph more likely to lose inhibitions) and they usually cook and eat their meals together. Ashley encourages Soph to do stuff that is fun to her whenever she's not feeling particularily well and to get exercise. They haven't quite agreed on a "safe" sleep schedule, as Soph does most of her work during the night, so instead she keeps her environment and influences safe to be in.

parents supportive
school not so much

Ashley's parents raised her in as gender neutral a way as they could think of. Her dad is a musician and her mum a secondary school history teacher. They don't have or make alot of money, and live in a terraced house in a northern town. Her parents are fully accepting and supportive of her gener identity.

When she was young, she was in a friend group where everybody else was a boy (because young boys "eww girls" bs), and felt uncomfortable. Starting secondary school, other students, as well as teachers, are not accepting at all of her not conforming to the male gender stereotypes. She begins piecing things together, and understanding why she would feel uncomfortable about some stuff (i.e. that she's trans). During this time, she's only "friends" with a couple of people, but they are about her behind her back. This is the situation throughout her entire time at secondary school, and her town is terrible for meeting new cool people. 

When she was very young, Ashley picked up her dad's guitar, and immediately loved making sounds on it. She learned to play quickly and with much joy, and when she was a young teenager had the opportunity to try playing a bass, which she loved even more, and so she began playing bass.

During her childhood and teenage years, Ashley spent a lot of her time learning to play guitar and bass to an advanced level, as well as getting into writing songs when she was a teenager. She also *loves* nautre and frequently goes on long walks in the forest with her dog, exploring and learning about all the different flora and fauna, and really at home.

As soon as she turns 18, she decides to move to London because there's not much to do in her town, and she doesn't have any friends there. She's also very passionate about making music, which draws her there.

She moves into a queer-friendly flatshare in hackney, where she lives with three roommates: X, Y, and Z. They're friendly and considerate, and everyone keeps the place clean and tidy. They cook for eachother, and hang out together fairly regularly. Ashley wants to practice bass regularily, which sometimes leads to conflict.
    X: friendly, temperamental, petty, creative, handy
    Y: shy, anxiety ridden, orderly, helpful, empathetic
    Z: kind, weak willed, hypocritical, warm-hearted, funny

-------------------- INSERT +1 FRIEND FROM ROOMMATES (probably X) --------------------

One day, SINGER, a friend of Z, had some over to visit. While she's there, she hears Ashley practing bass, and, liking it, asks Z who is playing, and Z suggests that SINGER knocks on Ashley's door to talk to her if she wants. SINGER asks Ashley if she could play some more, and then asks if Ashley is interested in coming to a band practice, to which Ashley immediately says yes. She ends up joining the band: "Ugly Giants".

--------------- ADD 2 FRIENDS FOR MICHAEL ---------------

Michael is an only child in a fairly bog standard family.

Between the ages of 8 and 11, he was raped many times by a family "friend" in his home. As a result, he develops PTSD, and also loses trust in his parents. He spends a lot of time online, learning about tech-related fields, mainly focusing on networking. He contributes to open source projects. He also plays videogames, and makes a few online friends [MAKE 2 FRIENDS]. As an adult he receives therapy, which, after many years of not receiving any, makes a significant positive change for his day-to-day life. Sadly this help ends before he's able to complete the trauma-related section of therapy. 



### Michael meeting Storm:

#### Suicide reasons:
- PTSD symptoms - Shame, fear, guilt, heightened stress response
- No workplace
- No social support system
- FEELINGS FROM STUDY
<br>
- No hope for things getting better, especially because he doesn't have therapy anymore

#### Overview
1. Storm chats michael up
2. Michael refuses
3. Storm asks general questions and finds out more about Michael's life in general, his thoughts, outlook on life (who views this as Storm trying to distract him)(figures out that he has not work, that he doesn't have anyone to spport him, that in his mind he has nothing to live for, suspects that Michael has been through severe trauma in the past)
4. Storm has found out attack points and acts on them @ @@ (as he does this (sharing his own trauma bit) now getting to know more surely that michael also went through some traumna from michael's responses to his story)
5. Ding! It works
6. Michael gets out of physical danger
7. Keep talking on overpass. Michael is now more open to share. Shares the story of what happened in prison
8. Michael suggests going home, Storm's like "nope" (wants him to come with him instead so he can make sure he stays safe)
9. heading to the space
10. Talking there

<br>

#### 1. Storm chats michael up
Seeing michael, sets himself the goal to stop michael from killing himself

#### 2. Michael refuses initially

#### 3. Storm asks general questions and finds out more about Michael's life in general, his thoughts, outlook on life (Michael views this as Storm trying to distract him)(storm figures out that he has no work, that he doesn't have anyone to spport him, that in his mind he has nothing to live for, suspects that Michael has been through severe trauma in the past)
Storm trying to understand how michael's head works to figure out how to begin changing Michael's mind about killing himself by asking Michael about general life things, (not asking about what has brought Michael to this place.) Michael interprets this as a distraction and slightly irritating, but he understands that storm is trying to do something nice and goes along with answering his questions, but a few of the things that storm says result in a temporary hightened level of irritation which results in a few sharp responses from michael.

#### 4. Storm has found out attack points and acts on them @ @@ (as he does this (sharing his own trauma bit) he begins to know more surely that Michael also went through some trauma from Michael's responses to his story)

Storm begins to suggest to Michael fixes to individual issues which he picked up that Michael has in his life:
[OTHER STUFF BEFORE OR AFTER]
PUT BELOW LAST IN THIS UnorderedList

@ Storm tells Michael about his past traumas. He empathises with Michael.
@@ He tells him that and is able to offer him a support system & World would lose something without Michael


#### 5. Ding! It works

#### 6. Michael gets out of physical danger

#### 7. Keep talking on overpass. Michael is now more open to share. Shares the story of what happened when he was young
Storm takes a step back and stops asking questions to give Michael some space to talk (LFM).

After a while of sitting together in silence, talks  all of past (significant points), storm practices active listening (LFM)
and after, offers to hug Michael (Learned From Mayhem)
- Emotional support (comforting)
- Gagueing how badly he's shaking atm

#### 8. Michael suggests going home, Storm's like "nope" suggests to come with him instead (so he can make sure he stays safe); Michael agrees, as he has nothing to lose.


#### 9. heading to the squat
Smalltalk

#### 10. Talking at the squat
storm brings Michael to one of the common rooms in the squat, and (because this is not the kind of thing you sleep after) they continue talking. As they talk, Storm gets to know Michael's technical abilities and personality better. Storm sees that he is very capable, and that his characher matches with the group's values, and so he tells Michael about the group and its objectives, shows him their space, and invites him to join.

(Can offer purpose/goal)
Michael's kindness and wanting to help people helps Storm to convince him to join the group 

The next morning, Michael meets the other group of squatters on the second floor, and they have breakfast together, and storm pops outside to bring Dev (who was sleeping in his van nearby) over to eat with them. Michael gets on well with them.

Later in the day, Mayhem and Soph also come to the space and meet Michael, and the whole group chats together.

Michael moves into the squat, and starts to work on the space and the project.

<summary markdown="span" style="font-size:1.5em; font-weight:bold">Dev</summary>
Whilst fighting against nazis as a partisan in France, Dev's father was in desperate need of a place to hide, and a friend of his contacted Dev's mother, who allowed him to hide in her home. Dev was born during the war, and moved to the UK as a young child.
    
As teenager broke into an abandoned place w/ friends (UrbEx). It was a burned down mansion.


------------------------------ INSERT MORE PRE 40YO STORIES ----------------------------
    
In the '80s, Dev and his friend were hanging out, when a group of four extreme right wing 20-something year old rich-kids perceived his friend to be effeminate. Assuming they were a gay couple, they verbally attacked them, and when Dev didn't take any shit, telling them to "fuck off", they became physically aggressive. Dev defended himself effectively, but unfortunately, when four rich kids with good lawyers and the only injuries come up against two guys with public defenders, who's the jury going to lean towards? Dev's mother was outraged that he has been unjustly imprisoned, while his father was more resigned to the inevitability of unfairness.
    
In prison, Dev came across a computer hacker who told him stories about what he had done and what was possible in terms of computer hacking. This really interested Dev, who went on to extensively familiarise himself with computers. Through the years, Dev followed along with the developments in the computer and hacking world, thereby acquiring a good understanding starting from the very fundamentals. He branched out to electronics, and began creating useful contraptions (e.g. short range emergency radio location system (for mountain/avalanche), or ambient intensity activated head torch).
    
Dev's mum died in the '00s, with his dad wasting away his last few years grieving her loss. Not wanting himself to waste part of the rest of his life like this, Dev made it his mission to have fun experiencing the world and going on adventures.

Dev lives in a van and travelles around hackerspaces. He discovers a queer-friendly squat, and befriends the squatters.

At some point, he's recruiting for a satellite hacking CTF competition, and storm asks to join. Dev accepts.

They get along very well together

Anarchist heart, travelles alot, aesthetic influenced by travels, so aesthetic = ((X * travelles) + (Y * Punk)) / 2

<summary markdown="span" style="font-size:1.5em; font-weight:bold">Nova</summary>

Lives in QMUL shared kitchen and bathroom dorms.

Passion for insects and reptiles. Has colourful insects (incl. mantis/es) and lizard.

She's ace.

She recently participated in a CTF where she won some money, which she used for tattoos.

When she comes out as ace, her parents try their best, but don't really understand.

Parents care about her, and have fun spending time and doing cool things with her. (e.g. going on trips for a day or a few regularly, and doing cool activities week to week). They also stand up for her and support her whenever anything bad happens (e.g. when being targeted by racist bullies at school, she'd punch them or something, and her parents would stand up for this to the school).

Gets in trouble at school for constantly being late on homework.

School suspects she has ADHD, and refers her to mental health services for diagnosis and treatment. She gets diagnosed and treated, including with medication, and this is effective. It keeps her on track, but ADHD doesn't go away.

In her secondary school friend group (which Mayhem is also a part of), she perceives the group as a very healthy and caring group, with the occasional disagreement, as normal for any group.

Another member of the friend group, Eileen, has a cool bug, which Nova finds super interesting, which gets her into bugs.

She was in a relationship where the other person didn't respect her boundaries, so she immediately dumped them.

--------------- REALISM CHECK ---------------

--------------- 6 SQUATTERS ---------------

Squat is large disused office space building (callcenter/s or something else or a single use or mixed use?), within tube range, but not too central. Building has 4 floors (G,1,2,3), with approximately 30 squatters living there. The group has their stuff set up on the second floor, which they share with 6 other squatters, as far as possible from the stairwells.

The 6 other squatters on the second floor get along with our group. The groups don't interact with eachother too much, and mostly just do their own thing and don't get in each other's way. A couple of times per month, they'll chill out together, doing some fun activities and eating together.

Occasionally, noise will be a problem, with mainly Mayhem blasting bangers out of the sound system. Another thing which can cause worry to our group, and especially to storm, is new people they've never seen before visiting the floor.
